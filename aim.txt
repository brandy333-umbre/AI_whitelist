what is the purpose of the app?:
-This is a productivity desktop application, that

flow on user end:
-user opens double clicks the app once it is installed from the website 
-the first time the user is loading the application, they will be asked 
to enter their email, then they will click the next button
-They will then be prompted to enter 3 email addresses of people they trust,
they email adresses will be labbelled 1 2 and 3 and, they
are told that this is so that they cannot unblock the proxy once it is active
unless they retrieve the 12 digit passwords from each person and enter them,
they are told that this is done to make the block effective,

-once the user has entered 3 valid email adresses
they click the next button and then the application will close

backend:
a random 12 digit string of characters is generated for each email entered,
these 3 12 digi random strings combined is the password for the users account
an email from Anchorite, (not from the users own email adress) will be sent to
 each of the email adresses that the user entered,
the email subject will say "Anchorite password {email address number} for 
{users email}"
the body of the email will then contain the 12 digit random number 

frontend:
-a prompt appears asking what the user would like to achieve in this session,
they are asked to make this response specific, the users response must be
at least 50 characters long,

-then they click the next button, if their response is less than 50 characters long
they are presented with an error stating that their mission statement must be at
least 50 characters long, if they click the next button successfully 

-if they click the next button successfully then the user is presented with a prompt
asking how many minutes they would like to allocate to this task with 
a maximum of 300 minutes

-the user then clicks the complete button, but if their allocated time is more
than 300 minutes then they are presented with an error stating that the time
must be less than 300 minutes, if they click the next button with a time
less than or equal to 300 minutes, the window closes and the proxy is then activated

-then the user will browse the web as usual but when they try and visit a website
that is not related to their mission the website will be blocked

-when the time allocated to the mission is finnished the app will activate a
popup window that shows two collumns one collumn is all the websites that 
the user visited, the collumn next is a list of binary ratings 
(basically a checkbox or toggle) for each website, this rating is either 1 (productive)
or 0 (distracting) based on how useful the website was for the users mission. 
once they have rated all the websites they want to they can click the complete button. 
They can also close the window without rating any websites, the rating they have given 
each website is fed back into the machine learning algorithm automatically
