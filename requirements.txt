# Focus Blocker - Python Dependencies
# All dependencies are part of Python standard library, so no external packages are required

# Core dependencies (built into Python):
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - threading (multithreading support)
# - time (time utilities)
# - os (operating system interface)
# - sys (system-specific parameters)
# - signal (signal handling)
# - secrets (cryptographically strong random numbers)
# - hashlib (hash algorithms)
# - json (JSON encoder/decoder)
# - platform (platform identification)
# - datetime (date and time utilities)
# - subprocess (subprocess management)
# - ctypes (C compatible data types)

# No external packages required - this application uses only Python standard library modules
