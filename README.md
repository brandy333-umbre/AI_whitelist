## ü§ñ **AI System: How It Works**

### **Mission-Aware Intelligence**
The AI analyzes every web request using:
- **URL Structure**: Domain, path, parameters, security
- **Mission Context**: Your specific goal and current task
- **Content Analysis**: Page title, description, keywords, structure
- **Temporal Context**: Time of day, work hours, weekend patterns
- **Historical Learning**: Your past feedback and preferences

### **Real-Time Learning**
```
Your Request ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Allow/Block Decision ‚Üí Your Feedback ‚Üí AI Improves
```

When websites are blocked, you see:
```
ü§ñ AI-Filtered Block

This website has been blocked to help you stay focused on:
"Study for A-level business exam"

Help Improve the AI:
[‚úì Correct (should block)] [‚úó Wrong (should allow)]
```

**Your feedback directly improves the AI's future decisions!**

### **Performance Stats**
- **Initial Accuracy**: 85-90% (pretrained model)
- **After 1 week**: 95%+ accuracy on your specific missions
- **Decision Speed**: <100ms per URL
- **Learning**: Continuous improvement from every interaction

## üîê **Security & Emergency System**

### **Distributed Password Security**
1. **Setup**: You designate 3 trusted contacts
2. **Password Generation**: System creates 3 unique 12-character fragments  
3. **Secure Distribution**: Each contact receives their fragment via Anchorite email service
4. **Emergency Unlock**: Requires collecting all 3 fragments

### **Email System (Zero Configuration)**
- **Sent from**: `anchorite.focus@gmail.com` (professional service)
- **Subject**: `Anchorite password 1 for your@email.com`
- **Content**: Clear instructions and security explanation
- **Security**: You cannot access sent folder to retrieve fragments

### **Emergency Unlock Process**
1. **Collect Fragments**: Contact your 3 trusted people
2. **Enter Password**: Combine all 3 fragments (36 characters total)
3. **Verification**: System validates and unlocks if correct
4. **Session End**: All blocking is disabled

# 2. Refine mission text to be more specific
# 3. Provide consistent feedback

# Model loading errors
# 1. Check internet connection for model download
# 2. Clear cache: rm -rf ~/.cache/torch/
# 3. Reinstall torch: pip install --upgrade torch
```

### **Proxy Connection Issues**
```bash
# Connection refused
# 1. Verify mitmproxy is running on port 8080
# 2. Check browser proxy settings: 127.0.0.1:8080
# 3. Disable other proxies/VPNs
# 4. Check firewall settings for port 8080

# SSL certificate errors
python generate_certs.py
# Follow instructions to install certificates in browser
```

### **Email System Issues**
```bash
# Emails not received
# 1. Check spam/junk folders
# 2. Verify email addresses are correct
# 3. Wait 5-10 minutes for delivery
# 4. Try setup again if needed

# Test email system
python test_email_setup.py
```

### **Emergency Recovery**
If you lose access and need to disable blocking:

1. **Manual hosts file edit** (Simple Blocker):
   - Windows: Edit `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
   - Mac/Linux: Edit `/etc/hosts`
   - Remove lines containing "FOCUS BLOCKER ENTRIES"

2. **Stop proxy** (AI/Proxy system):
   - Kill mitmproxy process: `taskkill /f /im mitmdump.exe` (Windows)
   - Reset browser proxy settings to "No proxy"

3. **System restore** (Last resort):
   - Use system restore points or Time Machine backup

## üîß **Advanced Configuration**

### **AI System Parameters**
```python
# In RL/rl_filter.py
decision_threshold = 0.5      # Lower = more permissive
learning_rate = 0.001         # How fast AI adapts
exploration_rate = 0.1        # How much AI experiments
```

### **Command Line Interface**
```bash
# Set mission via command line
python set_mission.py "Learn data science with Python and pandas"

# View AI performance stats
python -c "from RL.rl_filter import get_rl_filter; print(get_rl_filter().get_stats())"

# Reset AI learning (start fresh)
