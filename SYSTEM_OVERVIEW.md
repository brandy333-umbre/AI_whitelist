- **Configurable strictness**: Strict mode vs. permissive mode
- **Example templates**: Pre-built missions for common scenarios

## 📊 Data Flow

```
User Request → Browser → Proxy (port 8080) → Filter Logic → Allow/Block Decision
                                     ↓
Mission Config ← Agent ← Session State ← GUI Interface
                   ↓
              Watchdog Monitor → Restart Logic
```

### Request Processing Pipeline
1. Browser sends request to proxy (127.0.0.1:8080)
2. Proxy filter script analyzes URL and content
3. Filter checks against mission configuration:
   - Allowed domains list
   - Blocked domains list  
   - Keyword patterns
   - Local network exceptions
4. Decision made: Allow or block
5. Response generated (original content or block page)
6. Request logged to appropriate log file

## 🛡️ Security Model

### Threat Protection
- **Process termination**: Watchdog prevents easy killing
- **File manipulation**: Configuration files protected by session state
- **System bypass**: Proxy intercepts all traffic (when configured)
- **Session tampering**: Encrypted session files with integrity checks
- **Password attacks**: Cryptographically secure password generation

### Attack Resistance
- **Task Manager**: Agent process monitoring and restart
- **Network bypass**: Requires proxy reconfiguration to bypass
- **File deletion**: Session files recreated automatically
- **Process elevation**: Requires admin rights to modify system
