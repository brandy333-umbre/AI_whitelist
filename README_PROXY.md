# Focus Blocker Pro - Proxy-Based Productivity Enforcer

An advanced productivity enforcement system that uses HTTPS proxy filtering to create truly unbreakable focus sessions. Unlike simple host file blockers, this system intercepts all web traffic and intelligently filters it based on your mission and productivity goals.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Capabilities
- **HTTPS Proxy Filtering**: Intercepts all web traffic through a local proxy
- **Mission-Based Filtering**: Allows only websites relevant to your current goal
- **Unbreakable Sessions**: Password-protected sessions that resist tampering
- **Automatic Restart**: Watchdog system restarts proxy if it crashes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Track all allowed and blocked requests
- **Smart Keyword Filtering**: AI-like content filtering based on mission keywords

### Security & Resistance
- **Password Splitting**: Emergency unlock password split into 3 parts for friends
- **Process Monitoring**: Prevents easy termination of the monitoring process
- **Session Persistence**: Resumes sessions after system restart
- **Tamper Resistance**: Multiple layers of protection against circumvention

### User Experience
- **Modern GUI**: Intuitive tabbed interface for all features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live countdown and status updates
- **Mission Configuration**: Easy setup of allowed domains and keywords
- **Activity Logs**: View detailed logs of blocked and allowed requests

## üìã Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** (Required for modern security features)
- **Windows 10/11** (Primary support, Linux/macOS compatible)
- **Administrator/sudo privileges** (Required for proxy operations)
- **Modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge supported)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Installation
```bash
# 1. Download the project files
# 2. Run the setup script
python setup_and_run.py install

# 3. Configure your browser proxy settings (see instructions below)
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test the installation
python setup_and_run.py test
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Browser Configuration

To use Focus Blocker Pro, you must configure your browser to route traffic through the proxy:

### Chrome/Edge
1. Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí System ‚Üí Open proxy settings
2. Manual proxy setup ‚Üí Use a proxy server: ON
3. Address: `127.0.0.1`, Port: `8080`
4. Bypass proxy for: `localhost;127.0.0.1`

### Firefox
1. Settings ‚Üí Network Settings ‚Üí Settings
2. Manual proxy configuration
3. HTTP/HTTPS Proxy: `127.0.0.1`, Port: `8080`
4. No proxy for: `localhost,127.0.0.1`

### Certificate Installation
**IMPORTANT**: You must install the mitmproxy certificate for HTTPS filtering:
1. Start a focus session
2. Visit `http://mitm.it` in your browser
3. Download and install the certificate for your browser
4. This step is required for HTTPS sites to work properly

## üéØ Usage

### Starting a Focus Session

#### Method 1: GUI Interface
```bash
python focus_gui_controller.py
```
1. Enter your task description
2. Select session duration
3. Configure your mission in the "Mission Config" tab
4. Click "Start Unbreakable Focus Session"
5. Save the 3-part password (share with trusted friends)

#### Method 2: Command Line
```bash
# Start a 2-hour focus session
python proxy_focus_agent.py start 2 "Learn Python programming"

# Check session status
python proxy_focus_agent.py status

# End session early (requires password)
python proxy_focus_agent.py stop <full_password>
```

#### Method 3: Background Daemon
```bash
# Run as background service
python proxy_focus_agent.py daemon
```

### Mission Configuration

Edit your mission to define what websites and content are allowed:

```json
{
  "title": "Learn Python Programming",
  "description": "Focus on learning Python development skills",
  "allowed_domains": [
    "python.org",
    "docs.python.org", 
    "stackoverflow.com",
    "github.com",
    "pypi.org",
    "realpython.com"
  ],
  "allowed_keywords": [
    "python",
    "programming", 
    "coding",
    "development",
    "tutorial",
    "documentation"
  ]
}
```

### Emergency Unlock

If you need to end a session early:
1. Get all 3 password parts from your trusted friends
2. Combine them into one string (part1+part2+part3)
3. Use the emergency unlock feature in the GUI
4. Or use command line: `python proxy_focus_agent.py stop <combined_password>`
